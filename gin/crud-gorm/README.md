# Go API Boilerplates - gin/crud-gorm

This is a basic example of Go API
with [gin-gonic/gin][gin-gonic/gin], PostgreSQL and [GORM][go-gorm/gorm].

A full list of libraries used can be found in [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

## Development

This project can be booted up either

- natively with Go installed locally (assuming dependencies like PostgresSQL, Redis, etc. also exist)
- or by Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc. are included out of the box)

Please refer to [Makefile](./Makefile) or [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for details.

By default, the server will run at <http://localhost:3333>, but everything is configurable via [.env](.env) file.

### Tools

Some common development tools are introduced for better local development experience.

- [cosmtrek/air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) - Live reload for Go apps
- [GoTestTools/gotestfmt](https://github.com/GoTestTools/gotestfmt) - go test output for humans
- [swaggo/swag][swaggo/swag] - Automatically generate RESTful API documentation with Swagger 2.0 for Go.

```
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
go install github.com/gotesttools/gotestfmt/v2/cmd/gotestfmt@latest
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

Alternatively, use `make install` to install the required Go tooling locally.

### Documentation

This service has integrated [swaggo/swag][swaggo/swag] to create OpenAPI documentation automatically.

Use command `make swagg` or `swag init` to run the generation.

Then navigate to <http://localhost:3333/swagger/index.html> to view the API documentation.
